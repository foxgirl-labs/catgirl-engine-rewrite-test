## ReadMe

If you are wanting to submit a PR, there's a couple of things for you to note:

* I'm currently refactoring the entire codebase to reduce technical debt and make unit tests easier to write.

* I'm currently in the process of reviewing over all my depedencies' licenses and am determining if they are compatible with my project's current license. If they are not, I may change the license of the project, and would have to ask if you're okay with submitting a PR to a different license.


After I finish the above two tasks, I'll be editing/removing this message.
