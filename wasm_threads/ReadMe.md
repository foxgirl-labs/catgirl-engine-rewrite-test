# Wasm Threads

This will eventually become a drop in replacement for `std::thread` on the platform, wasm32-unknown-unknown.

It currently is at the very beginning stages. This is developed alongside the [catgirl game engine](https://crates.io/crates/catgirl-engine) crate, so features which the catgirl-engine crate will need will be prioritized.

Eventually, this crate may be split into its own repository, however, for now, it's a part of the catgirl-engine repo as I'm developing this crate specifically for the catgirl-engine.
